# Dynamical Systems Plotting tools!

this is a simple project, and a part of my studies/homeworks in SHARIF university

## plotting tools:
[1] limit sycles
[2] phase portraits
[3] orbitDiagram (Maybe call it bifurcation diagram)
[4] tent map
[5] rays in polar plot of prime numbers (i named it raysInPPP)

## how to use:
1. install python and pip
2. run:
    pip install requirments
3. edit the main.py for your problem
4. run:
    python main.py

in some systems you should run pip3 or python3
